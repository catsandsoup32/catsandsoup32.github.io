Hi, I'm Edmund! I'm a first year student at UC San Diego majoring in electrical engineering and math-CS. I'm interested in robotics 🤖 and interpretability📡, and I plan to pursue a master's degree in the future. In my free time, I like to climb plastic rocks 🧗, lift heavy circles 🏋️, and hit tiny balls 🏓.
